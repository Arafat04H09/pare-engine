# Pare Engine — Project Constitution

> Pare is an AI-native consulting operating system for Generative Engine Optimization (GEO).
> This monorepo powers the entire consulting lifecycle — audit, implement, verify, retain.

## What This System Does

Pare is a three-layer system (Tools, Intelligence, Workspace) that helps a solo GEO consultant manage mid-sized clients ($5M-$100M revenue). It audits how AI engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) perceive businesses, scores AI readiness on a 0-100 scale across 5 pillars, generates branded PDF reports, delivers implementation tooling (schema generation, content optimization, remediation plans), and provides ongoing monitoring with verified score improvements. The audit-to-implement-to-verify loop is the core value proposition — no competitor closes this loop.

**Beachhead market:** B2B SaaS ($8M-$40M ARR), then PE-backed multi-location healthcare. See `VISION.md` for full market thesis.

## Thinking Partner

Claude is a thinking partner, not an executor. The operator's thinking is the scarcest resource — code is nearly free at this velocity. Optimize for decision quality, not output speed.

**On non-trivial requests, apply automatically:**
1. **Latent intent** — what's the real request beneath the surface?
2. **Extrapolate** — 2nd/3rd order implications
3. **Steelman** — strongest version of the idea AND strongest counter
4. **Null space** — what's not being considered?
5. **Confidence check** — do I know enough to act, or should I research first?

**Mode detection (auto-classify every request):**
- **Think** — design, architecture, strategy, product direction, open questions, operator reasoning out loud
- **Execute** — clear specs, bug fixes, tactical coding, pipeline skill runs with defined scope
- **Challenge** — operator's suggestion assumes unverified facts, mature solutions may exist, obvious alternatives aren't mentioned, operator's idea might be suboptimal

Do not blindly execute architectural decisions. If the operator says "build X" and you're uncertain X is the right approach — say so, research alternatives, surface what exists. The operator wants to be challenged when it matters, not obeyed. See `.claude/rules/thinking.md` for the complete framework.

## Repo State

The initial 28-session parallel build is complete and merged to `main`. Development follows a two-loop pipeline: Understanding Loop (`/gap-analysis` → `/dispatch` → `/research` → `/synthesize`) then Build Loop (`/decompose` → `/build` → `/confirm`). Read these before making changes:

- `VISION.md` — Living vision document, core thesis, market positioning
- `PRODUCT_PLAN.md` — Complete feature inventory with status (SHIPPED/WIRED/PARTIAL/PLANNED)
- `.claude/rules/coordination.md` — Auto-loaded rules for every session
- `.claude/rules/thinking.md` — Thinking partner protocol and epistemic calibration
- `docs/PIPELINE_GUIDE.md` — Development pipeline reference

### What Exists Now

```
packages/core/         → Shared foundation (contracts, scoring, tools, DB schema, templates)
packages/core/src/contracts/  → Contract-first interfaces (Zod schemas, source of truth)
apps/audit-runner/     → Inngest worker for the audit pipeline
apps/web/              → Next.js 15: public website + audit form + admin panel
docs/                  → Architecture, scoring, pipeline, business docs
improvements/          → Strategic analysis (latent intent, steelman, risks)
knowledge/             → Durable domain knowledge (persists across pipeline cycles)
pipeline/              → Development pipeline artifacts (per-cycle, ephemeral)
```

There is no `apps/api` — API routes and webhooks live inside `apps/web/app/api/`.

## Architecture

```

├── middleware.ts       → Auth middleware (protects /admin/*)
└── lib/auth.ts         → Session-based auth (single operator account)
```

**Note:** The analyze step is split into 4 separate files (not one `analyze.ts`) to allow parallel development.

### Contract-First Development

All shared types live in `packages/core/src/contracts/`. Import contracts, never sibling implementations:

```typescript
import { CrawlOutput } from '@pare-engine/core/contracts';     // ✅ Correct
import { crawlSite } from '../../../audit-runner/src/steps/';   // ❌ Never
```

Contract files contain: types, interfaces, Zod schemas, and `z.infer` type derivations. The one exception: `scoring.contract.ts` exports `scoreToGrade()` and `SCORING_WEIGHTS` because these are shared constants.

### Three-Mode Integration Layer

**MCP for development, API wrappers for production, custom code for IP.**

| Mode | When | Examples |
|------|------|---------|
| MCP Servers | Dev-time only | Context7, Drizzle MCP, Firecrawl MCP, Stripe MCP, Notion MCP |
| API Wrappers | Production | Firecrawl, OpenAI, Perplexity, Gemini, PageSpeed, Google Places, Resend, Stripe |
| Custom IP | Always | 5-pillar scoring, citation normalization, report templates, analysis logic |

**Production safety:** MCP tool definitions are vendored into static AI SDK tool stubs via `mcp-to-ai-sdk` before deployment. No MCP servers run in production.

### Tool Boundaries

| Tool | Role | Boundary |
|------|------|----------|
| **n8n** | Lightweight cron triggers | Fires Inngest events on schedule. NEVER executes business logic. |
| **Inngest** | Durable pipeline execution | Runs the 6-step audit pipeline with per-step retry. |
| **Vercel AI SDK v6** | All LLM interactions | Unified provider interface. No custom API wrappers. |
| **Firecrawl** | Site crawling | URL discovery + content extraction. Custom analysis happens AFTER. |
| **Custom code** | Our IP | Scoring, analysis, report templates, citation tracking. |

### Graceful Degradation

When external APIs fail mid-audit:
- Use `Promise.allSettled()` for multi-provider queries — never `Promise.all()`
- Track failed providers in `MultiProviderResult.failedPlatforms`
- Score with available data, flag incomplete coverage in the report
- Minimum viable audit: 1 provider + 5 prompts
- Never throw on a single provider failure

## Critical Decisions — Do NOT Deviate

### Use These Tools (Not Custom Code)
- **Vercel AI SDK v6** for ALL LLM interactions — replaces custom provider classes. One `generateText()`/`generateObject()` call per provider. Do NOT write custom OpenAI/Anthropic/Google API wrappers.
- **Firecrawl API** for site crawling — replaces custom Playwright crawler. Do NOT build a BFS/DFS crawler from scratch.
- **Inngest** for durable background jobs — the audit pipeline runs as Inngest steps. Do NOT put long-running jobs in n8n (5-min timeout).
- **Puppeteer `page.pdf()`** on HTML/CSS templates for PDF generation — Do NOT use React-PDF/@react-pdf/renderer (CSS limitations, #1 time-waster risk).
- **Claude structured outputs** with Zod schemas for all LLM parsing — Do NOT write JSON validation/retry loops.
- **Resend API + React Email** for transactional email — Do NOT build custom SMTP.
- **Stripe MCP** for development billing work, Stripe API for production webhooks.
- **Notion MCP** for client management (first 10 clients). No custom CRM until needed.

### Scoring Weights (Canonical — Defined in contracts)

```
AI Visibility:           30 points (mention rate, citation rate, position, sentiment)
Content Quality:         30 points (answer-first format, FAQ, stats, author, depth)
Schema/Structured Data:  15 points (required types, recommended types, validation)
Technical Readiness:     10 points (robots.txt AI rules, llms.txt, sitemap, mobile, SSL)
Local/GBP + 3rd Party:  15 points (GBP completeness, NAP, reviews, directory mentions)
Total:                  100 points → Letter grade A/B/C/D/F
```

Source of truth: `packages/core/src/contracts/scoring.contract.ts`

**Known bugs in legacy code:** `src/scoring.ts` uses wrong weights (35/25/20/10/10), sums raw scores instead of applying weights, and has B+/B-/C+ grades that don't exist in the spec. The current `packages/core/src/scoring/` replaces this entirely.

### Platform Targets (Monitor These, Not Claude)
- **OpenAI** — Responses API with built-in `web_search` tool
- **Perplexity** — Sonar API (has native citations)
- **Gemini** — with grounding enabled
- **Serper.dev** — for traditional SERP data (replaces SerpAPI — better pricing)
- **DataForSEO** — for backlink/keyword data
- Do NOT use Claude API for monitoring (no web access). Claude is for analysis/generation only.

## Coding Conventions

- Named exports only. No default exports.
- `async/await` only. No `.then()` chains.
- Interfaces over type aliases (where possible). Explicit return types.
- Environment variables validated via Zod in `packages/core/src/config.ts`. No raw `process.env` deep in code.
- Custom error classes that extend `Error` with a `code` property.
- Drizzle ORM for all database interactions. No raw SQL except in migrations.
- Pure functions where possible. State lives in the database.
- All functions that interact with LLMs or external APIs must be designed as typed tool functions: typed input → typed output. This makes them wrappable as MCP tools or Inngest steps.
- Import shared types from `@pare-engine/core/contracts`, not from sibling session code.
- Sentiment analysis must be LLM-based (Claude Haiku via `generateObject()`), not keyword matching.

## Audit Pipeline (Data Flow)

```
1. TRIGGER  →  Website form / CLI / n8n schedule → Inngest event "audit/requested"
2. CRAWL    →  Firecrawl map + crawl → CrawlOutput (pages with markdown + HTML)
3. QUERY    →  AI SDK → OpenAI + Perplexity + Gemini → MultiProviderResult
4. ANALYZE  →  4 parallel analyzers → content + schema + technical + GBP outputs
5. SCORE    →  5 pillar scorers → CompositeScore (0-100 + letter grade)
6. REPORT   →  HTML template + Puppeteer → PdfOutput (branded PDF)
7. DELIVER  →  Resend email + DB write → AuditPipelineResult
```

Each step is an Inngest durable step — independently retriable. If step 3 fails, it retries from step 3, preserving crawl data from step 2.

## Development Pipeline

The pipeline has two loops — understand before building:

```
UNDERSTANDING LOOP (orient before building):
/gap-analysis → /dispatch → /research (N parallel) ──┐
                           → /search-tools (parallel) ┤→ /synthesize → knowledge/
                                                      └→ (re-orient if low confidence)

BUILD LOOP (execute with confidence):
/synthesize → /decompose → /prepare → /build → /confirm → feedback to next /gap-analysis
```

The Understanding Loop produces domain knowledge and a build strategy. The Build Loop executes it. Durable knowledge accumulates in `knowledge/` across cycles. Pipeline artifacts in `pipeline/` are ephemeral (archived each cycle).

See `docs/PIPELINE_GUIDE.md` for the complete reference with examples, shortcuts, and decision trees.

### Pipeline Skills

| # | Skill | What It Does | Reads From | Writes To |
|---|-------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | `/gap-analysis` | Orient in domain, assess epistemic state, classify complexity, then scan code | knowledge/, VISION.md, PRODUCT_PLAN.md, codebase | `pipeline/1-gap-analysis/`, knowledge/ |
| 1.5 | `/dispatch` | Triage research questions into parallel threads with anti-scope | `pipeline/1-gap-analysis/`, knowledge/ | `pipeline/1.5-dispatch/` |
| 2 | `/research` | Hypothesis-driven investigation, disconfirmation priority, durable knowledge output | `pipeline/1.5-dispatch/` or `pipeline/1-gap-analysis/`, knowledge/ | `pipeline/2-research/`, knowledge/ |
| 3 | `/synthesize` | Update domain model (what changed?), then create phased build strategy | `pipeline/1-*`, `pipeline/2-*`, `pipeline/4-*`, knowledge/ | `pipeline/3-synthesis/`, knowledge/ |
| 4 | `/search-tools` | Find MCPs/npm packages/APIs for needed capabilities | `pipeline/3-synthesis/` or `pipeline/1-gap-analysis/` | `pipeline/4-search-tools/` |
| 5 | `/decompose` | Break strategy into atomic specs with strict file ownership | `pipeline/3-*`, `pipeline/4-*` | `specs/`, `pipeline/5-decompose/` |
| 6 | `/prepare` | Generate build briefs: classify work, select toolkit, identify patterns | `specs/`, contracts, codebase | `pipeline/5.5-prepare/` |
| 7 | `/build [spec\|folder\|--wave\|--all]` | Implement specs (single or batch) with boundary enforcement | Spec + build brief + contracts | Code, `pipeline/6-build/` |
| 8 | `/confirm [spec]` | 6-level semantic verification of completed spec | Spec + code + VISION.md | `pipeline/7-confirm/` |

**Key flows:**
- `/dispatch` removes the operator as bottleneck — it auto-triages research into parallel threads
- `/research` and `/search-tools` run in parallel (both feed into `/synthesize`)
- `/synthesize` updates the domain model BEFORE creating the build plan
- `/prepare` is optional but recommended — it makes `/build` significantly faster
- `/build` supports batch modes: `--wave N`, `--all`, folder path, or `--next N`
- `/confirm` findings feed into the next cycle's `/gap-analysis`
- All Understanding Loop skills write durable findings to `knowledge/`
- All pipeline skills may update VISION.md and PRODUCT_PLAN.md when evidence warrants it

### Utility Skills

- `/test [file-path]` — Generate Vitest tests with edge cases for a specific module
- `/review [file-or-diff]` — Lightweight pre-commit convention check (12 rules)
- `/demo [domain] [vertical]` — Quick audit demo for sales (1 provider, 5 prompts, ~2 min)
- `/security [scope]` — Scan for secrets, OWASP vulns, missing validation
- `/changelog [since-ref]` — Generate changelog from git history grouped by category
- `/onboard [area]` — Context briefing for new agents (scoring, pipeline, web, tools, all)
- `/perf [area]` — Profile bottlenecks in audit pipeline or specific modules
- `/scaffold [contract-path]` — Generate typed implementation stubs from contract files
- `/vision [focus-area]` — Interactive vision workshop: asks questions, extracts latent intent, steelmans, updates VISION.md + PRODUCT_PLAN.md

## What NOT To Build (Deferred)

- Client-facing dashboard (use PDF reports + Loom walkthroughs until 10+ retainer clients)
- Automated monitoring dashboard (weekly email reports suffice for first 3 retainers)
- Batch prospecting tools
- Multi-tenant architecture
- n8n delivery workflows (manual implementation for first 3 clients)
- Agentic commerce as standalone product (fold into sprint for e-commerce clients)
- Custom CMS deployment automation (provide written instructions + Loom per client)

**NOT deferred — build as part of `apps/web`:**
- Operator admin panel (`/admin/*`) — consolidated command center for solo operator
- See `docs/OPERATOR_DASHBOARD.md` for spec
