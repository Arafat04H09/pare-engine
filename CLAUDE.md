# Pare Engine — Project Constitution

> Pare Consulting is a GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) consulting agency.
> This monorepo is the audit engine that powers the business.

## What This System Does

Pare audits how AI engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) see local businesses, scores their AI readiness on a 0-100 scale across 5 pillars, generates branded PDF reports, and delivers actionable recommendations. The audit-to-implement-to-verify loop is the core value proposition — no competitor does this.

## Repo State

The repo is being built via 28 parallel sessions coordinated through a contract-first architecture. Read these before making changes:

- `COORDINATION.md` — Session ownership map, merge protocol, round launch order
- `BOOTSTRAP.md` — Round 0 checklist (git init, workspace fixes, app scaffolds)
- `sessions/S{N}/SPEC.md` — Per-session launcher specs
- `.claude/rules/coordination.md` — Auto-loaded rules for every session

### What Exists Now

```
packages/core/         → Shared foundation (types, contracts, scoring, DB schema)
packages/core/src/contracts/  → Contract-first interfaces (Zod schemas, source of truth)
packages/query-engine/  → SCAFFOLD (reference only, being replaced)
packages/site-crawler/  → SCAFFOLD (reference only, being replaced)
packages/report-generator/ → SCAFFOLD (reference only, being replaced)
sessions/              → 28 session SPEC.md files
docs/                  → Architecture, scoring, pipeline, business docs
```

### What Gets Created (via Bootstrap + Sessions)

```
apps/audit-runner/     → Inngest worker for the audit pipeline
apps/web/              → Next.js 15: public website + audit form + admin panel
```

There is no `apps/api` — API routes and webhooks live inside `apps/web/app/api/`.

### Scaffold Packages (Reference Only)

`packages/query-engine`, `packages/site-crawler`, and `packages/report-generator` are Gemini-generated scaffolds with mocked implementations. They are deleted after Round 2. During the transition:
- Treat their code as reference, not production
- Salvageable logic is documented in each session's SPEC.md under "Scaffold Salvage"

## Architecture

├── middleware.ts       → Auth middleware (protects /admin/*)
└── lib/auth.ts         → Session-based auth (single operator account)
```

**Note:** The analyze step is split into 4 separate files (not one `analyze.ts`) to allow parallel development by different sessions.

### Contract-First Development

All shared types live in `packages/core/src/contracts/`. Sessions import contracts, never sibling implementations:

```typescript
import { CrawlOutput } from '@pare-engine/core/contracts';     // ✅ Correct
import { crawlSite } from '../../../audit-runner/src/steps/';   // ❌ Never
```

Contract files contain: types, interfaces, Zod schemas, and `z.infer` type derivations. The one exception: `scoring.contract.ts` exports `scoreToGrade()` and `SCORING_WEIGHTS` because these are shared constants.

### Three-Mode Integration Layer

**MCP for development, API wrappers for production, custom code for IP.**

| Mode | When | Examples |
|------|------|---------|
| MCP Servers | Dev-time only | Context7, Drizzle MCP, Firecrawl MCP, Stripe MCP, Notion MCP |
| API Wrappers | Production | Firecrawl, OpenAI, Perplexity, Gemini, PageSpeed, Google Places, Resend, Stripe |
| Custom IP | Always | 5-pillar scoring, citation normalization, report templates, analysis logic |

**Production safety:** MCP tool definitions are vendored into static AI SDK tool stubs via `mcp-to-ai-sdk` before deployment. No MCP servers run in production.

### Tool Boundaries

| Tool | Role | Boundary |
|------|------|----------|
| **n8n** | Lightweight cron triggers | Fires Inngest events on schedule. NEVER executes business logic. |
| **Inngest** | Durable pipeline execution | Runs the 6-step audit pipeline with per-step retry. |
| **Vercel AI SDK v6** | All LLM interactions | Unified provider interface. No custom API wrappers. |
| **Firecrawl** | Site crawling | URL discovery + content extraction. Custom analysis happens AFTER. |
| **Custom code** | Our IP | Scoring, analysis, report templates, citation tracking. |

### Graceful Degradation

When external APIs fail mid-audit:
- Use `Promise.allSettled()` for multi-provider queries — never `Promise.all()`
- Track failed providers in `MultiProviderResult.failedPlatforms`
- Score with available data, flag incomplete coverage in the report
- Minimum viable audit: 1 provider + 5 prompts
- Never throw on a single provider failure

## Critical Decisions — Do NOT Deviate

### Use These Tools (Not Custom Code)
- **Vercel AI SDK v6** for ALL LLM interactions — replaces custom provider classes. One `generateText()`/`generateObject()` call per provider. Do NOT write custom OpenAI/Anthropic/Google API wrappers.
- **Firecrawl API** for site crawling — replaces custom Playwright crawler. Do NOT build a BFS/DFS crawler from scratch.
- **Inngest** for durable background jobs — the audit pipeline runs as Inngest steps. Do NOT put long-running jobs in n8n (5-min timeout).
- **Puppeteer `page.pdf()`** on HTML/CSS templates for PDF generation — Do NOT use React-PDF/@react-pdf/renderer (CSS limitations, #1 time-waster risk).
- **Claude structured outputs** with Zod schemas for all LLM parsing — Do NOT write JSON validation/retry loops.
- **Resend API + React Email** for transactional email — Do NOT build custom SMTP.
- **Stripe MCP** for development billing work, Stripe API for production webhooks.
- **Notion MCP** for client management (first 10 clients). No custom CRM until needed.

### Scoring Weights (Canonical — Defined in contracts)

```
AI Visibility:           30 points (mention rate, citation rate, position, sentiment)
Content Quality:         30 points (answer-first format, FAQ, stats, author, depth)
Schema/Structured Data:  15 points (required types, recommended types, validation)
Technical Readiness:     10 points (robots.txt AI rules, llms.txt, sitemap, mobile, SSL)
Local/GBP + 3rd Party:  15 points (GBP completeness, NAP, reviews, directory mentions)
Total:                  100 points → Letter grade A/B/C/D/F
```

Source of truth: `packages/core/src/contracts/scoring.contract.ts`

**Known bugs in legacy code:** `src/scoring.ts` uses wrong weights (35/25/20/10/10), sums raw scores instead of applying weights, and has B+/B-/C+ grades that don't exist in the spec. S2 replaces this entirely.

### Platform Targets (Monitor These, Not Claude)
- **OpenAI** — Responses API with built-in `web_search` tool
- **Perplexity** — Sonar API (has native citations)
- **Gemini** — with grounding enabled
- **Serper.dev** — for traditional SERP data (replaces SerpAPI — better pricing)
- **DataForSEO** — for backlink/keyword data (Round 6)
- Do NOT use Claude API for monitoring (no web access). Claude is for analysis/generation only.

## Coding Conventions

- Named exports only. No default exports.
- `async/await` only. No `.then()` chains.
- Interfaces over type aliases (where possible). Explicit return types.
- Environment variables validated via Zod in `packages/core/src/config.ts`. No raw `process.env` deep in code.
- Custom error classes that extend `Error` with a `code` property.
- Drizzle ORM for all database interactions. No raw SQL except in migrations.
- Pure functions where possible. State lives in the database.
- All functions that interact with LLMs or external APIs must be designed as typed tool functions: typed input → typed output. This makes them wrappable as MCP tools or Inngest steps.
- Import shared types from `@pare-engine/core/contracts`, not from sibling session code.
- Sentiment analysis must be LLM-based (Claude Haiku via `generateObject()`), not keyword matching.

## Audit Pipeline (Data Flow)

```
1. TRIGGER  →  Website form / CLI / n8n schedule → Inngest event "audit/requested"
2. CRAWL    →  Firecrawl map + crawl → CrawlOutput (pages with markdown + HTML)
3. QUERY    →  AI SDK → OpenAI + Perplexity + Gemini → MultiProviderResult
4. ANALYZE  →  4 parallel analyzers → content + schema + technical + GBP outputs
5. SCORE    →  5 pillar scorers → CompositeScore (0-100 + letter grade)
6. REPORT   →  HTML template + Puppeteer → PdfOutput (branded PDF)
7. DELIVER  →  Resend email + DB write → AuditPipelineResult
```

Each step is an Inngest durable step — independently retriable. If step 3 fails, it retries from step 3, preserving crawl data from step 2.

## What NOT To Build (Deferred)

- Client-facing dashboard (use PDF reports + Loom walkthroughs until 10+ retainer clients)
- Automated monitoring dashboard (weekly email reports suffice for first 3 retainers)
- Batch prospecting tools
- Multi-tenant architecture
- n8n delivery workflows (manual implementation for first 3 clients)
- Agentic commerce as standalone product (fold into sprint for e-commerce clients)
- Custom CMS deployment automation (provide written instructions + Loom per client)

**NOT deferred — build as part of `apps/web`:**
- Operator admin panel (`/admin/*`) — consolidated command center for solo operator
- See `docs/OPERATOR_DASHBOARD.md` for spec
